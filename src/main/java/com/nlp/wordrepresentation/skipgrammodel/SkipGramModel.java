/**
 * Predicts the likelihood of context words in the same sentence.
 * Hyperparameter includes the back and foward n-gram context lookup for w(t) where
 * w(t) is a word.
 *
 * Increasing the range will increase the computational complexity, but improves perfmance.
 *
 * Output is a prediction of surrounding words. Used in word2vec reprentation.
